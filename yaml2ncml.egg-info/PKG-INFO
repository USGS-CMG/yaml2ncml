Description: yaml2ncml
        =========
        
        NcML aggregation from YAML specifications.
        
        ``yaml2ncml`` is a command line tool to facilitate the creation of
        `NcML
        aggregation <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/thredds/current/netcdf-java/ncml/Aggregation.html>`__
        file for THREDDS servers.
        
        Install it using pip or conda.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install yaml2ncml
            # or
            conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/ioos yaml2ncml
        
        The user must create a YAML config file (see the example below) and run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            yaml2ncml roms.yaml
        
            # or save the output
        
            yaml2ncml roms.yaml --output roms_aggregation.ncml
        
        roms.yaml

        .. code:: yaml
        
            dataset:

                title: "USGS-CMG-COAWST Model: CBLAST2007 Ripples with SWAN-40m res"
        
                summary: "Simulation of hydrodynamics and bottom stress south of Marthas Vineyard, MA using the COAWST modeling system.  These results are from the 40m inner nest of a four-level nested simulation."

        Notes on the YAML file: 
        
        1. The aggregation `dir:` is the directory where the data (e.g. NetCDF files) are located, relative to the directory where the NcML will be.  In the above example, the NetCDF files are located in a subdirectory called "Output".  If the NetCDF files will be in the same directory as the NcML file, specify `dir: '.'`. 
        
        2. Specify that all variables should appear in the aggregation (none excluded) like this:
        
        .. code:: yaml
        
            variables:
                include:
                    - All
        
                exclude:
                    - None
